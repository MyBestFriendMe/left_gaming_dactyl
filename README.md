One-handed Dactyl handwired keyboard

The idea of this project was to make a simple and easily mappable one-handed gaming keyboard based around a dactyl build.
It is techinally a Dactyl Manuform 4x6_2_3 which is not on the main branch of the QMK firmware but I was able to get mine working great as just a single keyboard and removing the right hand parts. If anyone shows any interest then I will probably create a right-hand version or at make a full keyboard setup. I am really just posting this to see if anyone even has any insterest in this kind of thing. I will make a whole build sheet if anyone is interested but otherwise this is just a fun thing I made for myself. I have had to almost entirely modify every keyboard I have ever made so I'd be burried neck deep in these descriptions if I made the full tutorial for each build.

* Prep
  - I configured this dactyl from the dactyl configurator:

  - I use a filament 3D printer to create the physical case. You are more than welcome to use the STLs I attached for your build. I used 3mm heat-set threads
